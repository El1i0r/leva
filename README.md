# Leva
Leva is a implementation of Pie programming language from The Little Typer which expands on it's features and adds some interesting stuff.
It is mostly our playground for implementing Martin Lof Type Theory, and Calculus of Inductive Constructions.

# Installation
You must have `git` and `racket` installed on your system, after that clone this repository in some directory and finally run:

```bash
racket src/main.rkt # which would start a REPL... probably
```

Have fun playing playing around!
